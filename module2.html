                    Containership also referred to as composition allows a class to contain an object of a different class as a member data.
                    Ex: Class A could contain an object of class B as a member. Here, all the public methods (or functions) defined in B can be executed within the class A. Class A becomes the container, while class B becomes the contained class.
                     This can also be explained as class A is composed of class B.
